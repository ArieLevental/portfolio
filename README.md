|    | Feature           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|----|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ‚öôÔ∏è | **Architecture**  | The codebase follows a standard React application architecture, with components for different sections of the website. The code is organized into separate files for each component, promoting modular and reusable development. |                   |
| üîó | **Dependencies**  | The codebase uses several external dependencies such as font-awesome, lax.js, and React packages (React, ReactDOM). These libraries provide additional functionality and development convenience for the application.                |
| üß© | **Modularity**    | The codebase exhibits good modularity, with each component of the application separated into its own file. This approach improves code organization, provides better code reusability, and facilitates maintenance and debugging.   |
| üîÄ | **Version Control** | The codebase uses Git for version control, providing a robust mechanism to track changes, collaborate, and manage different versions of the project. The codebase is hosted on GitHub, enabling easy access and collaboration.                             |

| [index.css](https://github.com/ArieLevental/portfolio/blob/main/src/index.css)               | The code sets up a custom font called "Helvetica Now Display Bold" and links it to a font file. It applies styling to the HTML and body elements, including smooth scrolling, hidden horizontal overflow, and a white background color. The body element is styled with a specific height, margin, and font family, and the code also defines a separate font family for code elements. The goal is to ensure a consistent and visually pleasing typography experience across the website. |
| [index.js](https://github.com/ArieLevental/portfolio/blob/main/src/index.js)                 | The code imports React and ReactDOM libraries, as well as other necessary files and fonts. It renders the <App /> component using ReactDOM.render() to the HTML element with the id'root'. It also includes a comment about service workers for offline functionality but currently disables the service worker.                                                                                                                                                                           |
